## OVERVIEW

Outrank is a competitive trivia game where players bid on their ability to correctly rank sets of cards. Test your knowledge across countries and movies while strategically blocking opponents and managing limited resources.

## COMPONENTS

### Cards
- **80 Country Cards** - Each showing a country name and flag
- **94 Movie Cards** - Each showing movie title and year
- **Challenge Cards** - 66 different ranking challenges (33 per category)

### Tokens
- **Blocking Tokens** - 3 sets per player in values: 2, 4, 6 points
- **Score Tokens** - For tracking points during play
- **Player Markers** - 6 different colors

### Other Components
- **Bid Dials** - For secret bidding (1-10)
- **Rulebook** - This document
- **Score Pad** - For final scoring

## SETUP

1. **Choose Category:** All players agree on Countries OR Movies for the entire game
2. **Shuffle Cards:** Shuffle the chosen category deck
3. **Deal Blocking Tokens:** Each player receives one 2-point, one 4-point, and one 6-point blocking token
4. **Draw Challenge:** Reveal the top Challenge card
5. **Select Starting Player:** Youngest player goes first

## GAME FLOW

Each round consists of four phases:

### PHASE 1: CARD REVEAL
- Deal cards face-up equal to: (Number of players × 2) + 2
- Example: 4 players = 10 cards revealed
- These form the **Available Pool**

### PHASE 2: BIDDING
- Players simultaneously select their bid using bid dials (1-10)
- Bid represents how many cards you believe you can rank correctly
- Reveal bids simultaneously
- **Highest bidder wins** and becomes the **Active Player**
- Ties: Re-bid among tied players only

### PHASE 3: BLOCKING
- Starting with the player left of the Active Player, each opponent may:
  - **Block cards** by placing blocking tokens on them
  - **Pass** and do nothing
- Each blocking token can only block ONE card
- Blocked cards are **removed from the Available Pool**
- Blocking player **claims ownership** of blocked cards

### PHASE 4: RANKING CHALLENGE
- Active Player selects exactly their **bid number** of cards from remaining Available Pool
- Attempt to arrange selected cards in correct order according to the Challenge
- **Scoring:**
  - +3 points for each correctly positioned card
  - +1 point for each blocking token used by opponents this round
  - No penalty for incorrect positions

### PHASE 5: CLEANUP
- All used cards are **permanently removed** from the game
- Blocked cards remain with their owners (for end-game scoring)
- Used blocking tokens are **permanently removed**
- Draw new Challenge card for next round

## WINNING CONDITIONS

### Game End Triggers
The game ends when ANY of these occurs:
- **Insufficient cards:** Cannot deal minimum cards for a round
- **No blocking tokens:** All players have used all blocking tokens
- **Challenge deck empty:** All challenges have been used

### Final Scoring
Players add up:
1. **Round Points** - Points earned during gameplay
2. **Blocking Bonus** - 1 point per blocking token still in hand
3. **Owned Cards** - 1 point per card blocked and owned

**Highest total wins!**

## DETAILED RULES

### Bidding Rules
- **Minimum bid:** 1 card
- **Maximum bid:** 10 cards OR number of available cards (whichever is lower)
- **Tied bids:** Only tied players re-bid
- **Invalid bids:** Treated as bid of 1

### Blocking Strategy
- **Timing:** Blocking happens in turn order after bidding
- **Limitations:** Can only use tokens you still possess
- **Targeting:** Block cards you think the Active Player needs
- **Ownership:** Blocked cards belong to the blocking player permanently

### Ranking Mechanics
- **Exact number:** Must select exactly your bid number of cards
- **Arrangement:** Place cards in order according to challenge
- **Scoring:** Only correctly positioned cards score points
- **Partial credit:** No partial credit for "close" positions

### Token Economy
- **Starting tokens:** 2-point, 4-point, 6-point per player
- **One-time use:** Each token can only be used once per game
- **Blocking bonus:** Active Player gets +1 point per token used against them
- **End-game value:** Unused tokens worth their face value

## EXAMPLE CHALLENGES

### Countries Category
- "Rank by total land area (largest to smallest)"
- "Rank by coffee consumption per capita"
- "Rank by happiness index score"
- "Rank by GDP per capita"
- "Rank by population density"

### Movies Category
- "Rank by worldwide box office earnings"
- "Rank by production budget"
- "Rank by IMDb rating"
- "Rank by number of Oscar wins"
- "Rank by runtime (shortest to longest)"

## STRATEGY TIPS

### For Bidding
- **Conservative early:** Start with lower bids to learn the card pool
- **Aggressive late:** Higher bids when you know the remaining cards
- **Token awareness:** Consider how many blocking tokens opponents have left

### For Blocking
- **Target key cards:** Block cards that are obvious anchors for rankings
- **Save high-value tokens:** Use 2-point tokens early, save 6-point for crucial moments
- **Timing matters:** Sometimes passing is better than wasting tokens

### For Ranking
- **Anchor strategy:** Identify cards you're certain about first
- **Elimination method:** Rule out obviously wrong positions
- **Risk assessment:** Sometimes taking fewer cards is smarter than risking a high bid

## VARIANTS

### Speed Outrank
- 30-second time limit for all phases
- No re-bidding on ties (tied players both become active)

### Team Play
- 4 or 6 players in teams of 2
- Partners sit opposite each other
- Teams share blocking tokens and scores

### Challenge Draft
- Before game starts, each player chooses 3 Challenge cards
- Shuffle chosen challenges to create custom deck
- Ensures challenges players are interested in

## DESIGN NOTES

Outrank combines knowledge, strategy, and risk management. Success requires:
- **Knowledge** of the categories
- **Strategic thinking** about blocking and bidding
- **Resource management** of limited blocking tokens
- **Adaptability** as the card pool changes each round

The game rewards both broad knowledge and tactical play, making each game unique based on which cards and challenges appear.
