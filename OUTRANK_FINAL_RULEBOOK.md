## HOW TO PLAY

### Game Overview:
The game is played in rounds. All category pools (Countries and Movies) are always available with 10 tokens each. Each round begins with a player, able to see the top topic for each category and selecting which category to use, then the pool is drawn back up to 10 tokens if it is below. With the topic and the 10 category tokens visible, players bid on how many they can rank correctly, and the highest bidder attempts the challenge while opponents may try to block key tokens.

### Round Structure:

1. **Challenge Reveal:** Draw challenge from each category
2. **Category Selection:** Active selector chooses category for next round
3. **Bidding Phase:** Open bidding until all but one player has passed
4. **Blocking Phase:** Opponents use tokens strategically to block.
5. **Ranking Phase:** Winner attempts the challenge
6. **Cleanup Phase:** Remove ranked tokens, successfully blocked tokens and pass selector token

---

## DETAILED PHASE BREAKDOWN

### PHASE 0: CATEGORY SELECTION
**Duration:** 15 seconds

2. **Category Selector Chooses**
   - Player with Category Selector token announces: category
   - This determines which pool and challenges to use this round

3. **Strategic Consideration**
   - Selector can see exactly which cards are available
   - Can choose based on their knowledge of visible cards

**Example (Countries selected):**
```
Challenge: "Rank by Population (Highest to Lowest)"

Active Pool (10 cards already visible):
[Japan] [Brazil] [Egypt] [Canada] [India]
[Kenya] [Peru]  [Norway] [Spain] [Vietnam]
```

### PHASE 2: BIDDING

1. **Evaluate the Challenge**
   - Study the 10 tokens in active pool
   - Consider which you're confident about
   - Factor in blocking risks

2. **State Your Bid**
   - Bid = number of cards you'll rank
   - Maximum bid is always 10 (the pool size)
   - Bid always has to be at least 1 higher than the existing bid
   - Cannot bid zero

### PHASE 3: BLOCKING
**Duration:** 1 minute

1. **Blocking Order**
   - Start with non-winning bidder player in last place
   - Continue in reverse order of ranking
   - Winner cannot block

2. **Blocking Actions**
   Each player may either:
   - **Block:** Place one token on one card in active pool
   - **Pass:** Save tokens for later

3. **Blocking Rules**
   - One token per card maximum
   - Cannot remove tokens once placed
   - Blocked cards are removed from active pool if bidder is unsuccessful and Blocker owns that card (keeps near them) for future rounds

4. **Pool Reduction**
   - Active pool shrinks as cards are blocked
   - Winner must have enough cards for their bid
   - Pool will be refilled after blocking phase

**Blocking Example:**
Winner bid 6 cards from 10-card pool. Opponents block:
- Ben: Blocks "India" with 2-point token
- Carlos: Blocks "Norway" with 4-point token
- Dana: Passes
Result: 8 cards remain in active pool that Winner needs to rank 6 of

### PHASE 5: RANKING

1. **Card Selection**
   - Winner selects EXACTLY their bid number
   - From remaining unblocked cards only
   - Cannot select fewer or more

2. **Arrange Cards**
   - Place selected cards in a row
   - Order according to challenge
   - Left = First position
   - Right = Last position

3. **Lock In Answer**
   - Announce "Final Answer"
   - No changes after this
   - Other players verify count

4. **Reveal Correct Order**
   - Use companion app OR
   - Check answer sheet
   - Award points if they are successful in hitting their bid amount of ranked tokens

If they bid 6 and they get all 6 correct in order relative to each other, then they get 6 points. If they mess up any of them they get 0 points. (If they had bid 4 and they got 4 correct, they get 4 points, etc… 1 point per item bid but it's all or nothing)

If there were blocks on tokens and the bidder succeeds, they get to take the blocking tokens (not the category tokens) and use them in future rounds.

If there were blocks on tokens and the bidder fails, the blockers get the points on the blocker token they used as well as they now own the token that they blocked. (The country, movie, etc…)

At any time they are able to insert any category tokens they own in that category into the pool they are trying to rank after they have won the right to rank that turn in the bidding process.

### PHASE 6: CLEANUP
**Duration:** 30 seconds

1. **Remove Ranked Tokens**
   - All cards used in ranking → removed from game permanently

2. **Maintain Pool Size**
   - Active pool now has fewer than 10 tokens, so refill up to 10 tokens

4. **Update Scores**
   - Record points on score sheet
   - Announce running totals

5. **Pass Category Selector Token**
   - Category Selector token → clockwise to next player

6. **Ready for Next Round**
   - Both pools remain visible
   - New Category Selector can see exact cards available
   - Begin new round with category selection

## SCORING SYSTEM

### During Rounds:
- **Correct Ranking:** All or nothing - 1 pt for each token ranked 
- **No Penalty:** 0 points for wrong positions

---

## END GAME & VICTORY

### Game Ends When (ANY Condition):

1. **Insufficient Cards**
   - Cannot draw minimum for next round in Selected category
   - Example: Countries has 8 cards, Movies has 5, need 10

2. **Number of Rounds played equals 2x Players** (minimum 6, maximum 12)

3. **Number of points is equal to target set before game started.**

### Final Scoring Procedure:

2. **Count Bonuses**
   - Each player counts unused tokens
   - Each player counts owned tokens (from all categories)

3. **Calculate Totals**
   - Round points + Blocking Points + 1 pt for each block token owned + 1 pt for each category token owned
   - Highest total wins

4. **Tiebreakers**
   - Most points from correct Ranking (1st)
   - Most owned Category Tokens (2nd)
   - Shared victory

## STRATEGY GUIDE

### Category Selection Strategy

**When to Choose Your Strong Category:**
- You're behind in points
- You have high-value tokens
- Opponents are weak in that area

**When to Choose Your Weak Category:**
- You're ahead and playing safe
- You want to deny opponents
- You have few tokens left

**Reading the Table:**
- Track which categories players prefer
- Notice who struggles with what
- Use selection to control game flow

### Bidding Strategy

**Conservative Approach:**
- Bid 3-5 cards early
- Learn the card pool
- Save tokens for defense

**Aggressive Approach:**
- Bid 7-10 cards
- Force token usage
- Maximize point potential

**Situational Bidding:**
- Few tokens left? Bid high
- Many unknowns? Bid low
- Leading score? Play safe
- Behind? Take risks

### Blocking Strategy

**Token Management:**
- 2-point: Use early/often
- 4-point: Mid-game power
- 6-point: Save for crucial blocks

**What to Block:**
- Obvious extremes (largest/smallest)
- Cards you know
- Force difficult middle rankings

**When to Pass:**
- Low bids (not worth tokens)
- You need the cards too
- Saving for your turn

### Ranking Strategy

**The Anchor Method:**
1. Identify certain cards first
2. Place these as anchors
3. Fill gaps with educated guesses
4. Use elimination for remainder

**Risk Assessment:**
- 100% sure on 4? Bid 4
- 80% sure on 6? Maybe bid 5
- Consider blocking probability
