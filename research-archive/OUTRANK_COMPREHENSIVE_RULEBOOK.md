## HOW TO PLAY

### Game Overview:
The game is played in rounds. Both category pools (Countries and Movies) are always available with 10 cards each. Each round begins with a player selecting which category to use, then players bid on how many they can rank correctly, and the highest bidder attempts the challenge while opponents try to block key cards. After blocking, the used pool is refilled to 10 cards.

### Round Structure:
1. **Category Selection:** Active selector chooses Countries or Movies
2. **Challenge Reveal:** Draw challenge from chosen category
3. **Bidding Phase:** Secret simultaneous bidding (based on visible pool)
4. **Blocking Phase:** Opponents use tokens strategically
5. **Pool Refresh:** Refill selected pool back to 10 cards
6. **Ranking Phase:** Winner attempts the challenge
7. **Cleanup Phase:** Remove ranked cards, pass selector token

---

## DETAILED PHASE BREAKDOWN

### PHASE 0: CATEGORY SELECTION
**Duration:** 15 seconds

1. **View Both Pools**
   - Both pools always have 10 cards visible
   - Players can see all available cards before selection

2. **Category Selector Chooses**
   - Player with Category Selector token announces: "Countries" or "Movies"
   - This determines which pool and challenges to use this round

3. **Strategic Consideration**
   - Selector can see exactly which cards are available
   - Can choose based on their knowledge of visible cards
   - Both categories always remain viable options

### PHASE 1: CHALLENGE REVEAL
**Duration:** 15 seconds

1. **Draw New Challenge**
   - Flip the top Challenge card from the SELECTED category
   - Read it aloud to all players
   - Place it prominently in the center

2. **Active Pool**
   - The selected category's 10-card pool becomes the "Active Pool"
   - All 10 cards are available for bidding
   - Players have already seen these cards during category selection

**Example (Countries selected):**
```
Challenge: "Rank by Population (Highest to Lowest)"

Active Pool (10 cards already visible):
[Japan] [Brazil] [Egypt] [Canada] [India]
[Kenya] [Peru]  [Norway] [Spain] [Vietnam]
```

### PHASE 2: BIDDING
**Duration:** 45 seconds

1. **Evaluate the Challenge**
   - Study the 10 cards in active pool
   - Consider which you're confident about
   - Factor in blocking risks

2. **Set Your Bid**
   - Secretly set bid dial (1-10)
   - Bid = number of cards you'll rank
   - Maximum bid is always 10 (the pool size)
   - Cannot bid zero

3. **Simultaneous Reveal**
   - Count "3, 2, 1, Reveal!"
   - All players show bid dials
   - Highest bid wins

4. **Breaking Ties**
   - Only tied players re-bid
   - Other players keep original bids visible
   - Continue until one winner

**Bidding Example:**
- Anna bids 6
- Ben bids 4
- Carlos bids 6
- Dana bids 3
Result: Anna and Carlos re-bid (tie at 6)

### PHASE 3: BLOCKING
**Duration:** 1 minute

1. **Blocking Order**
   - Start with player to left of winner
   - Continue clockwise
   - Winner cannot block

2. **Blocking Actions**
   Each player may either:
   - **Block:** Place one token on one card in active pool
   - **Pass:** Save tokens for later

3. **Blocking Rules**
   - One token per card maximum
   - Cannot remove tokens once placed
   - Blocked cards are removed from active pool
   - Blocker owns that card (keeps near them)

4. **Pool Reduction**
   - Active pool shrinks as cards are blocked
   - Winner must have enough cards for their bid
   - Pool will be refilled after blocking phase

**Blocking Example:**
Winner bid 6 cards from 10-card pool. Opponents block:
- Ben: Blocks "India" with 2-point token
- Carlos: Blocks "Norway" with 2-point token  
- Dana: Passes
Result: 8 cards remain in active pool

### PHASE 4: POOL REFRESH
**Duration:** 30 seconds

1. **Count Remaining Cards**
   - Check how many cards remain in active pool after blocking
   - Calculate how many needed to return to 10

2. **Draw New Cards**
   - Draw cards from the selected category deck
   - Add them to the active pool
   - Pool returns to exactly 10 cards

3. **Arrange Pool**
   - Display all 10 cards clearly
   - Mix new and existing cards
   - Winner now selects from this refreshed pool

**Refresh Example:**
- Started with 10 cards
- 2 cards blocked (8 remain)
- Draw 2 new cards
- Pool back to 10 cards for ranking

### PHASE 5: RANKING
**Duration:** 2 minutes

1. **Card Selection**
   - Winner selects EXACTLY their bid number
   - From remaining unblocked cards only
   - Cannot select fewer or more

2. **Arrange Cards**
   - Place selected cards in a row
   - Order according to challenge
   - Left = First position
   - Right = Last position

3. **Lock In Answer**
   - Announce "Final Answer"
   - No changes after this
   - Other players verify count

4. **Reveal Correct Order**
   - Use companion app OR
   - Check answer sheet
   - Award points for correct positions

**Ranking Example:**
Challenge: "Rank by Population (Highest to Lowest)"
Selected 6 cards, arranged:
1. Brazil ✓ (+3)
2. Japan ✓ (+3)
3. Vietnam ✗
4. Egypt ✗
5. Spain ✓ (+3)
6. Canada ✓ (+3)
Score: 12 points + 2 blocking bonus = 14 total

### PHASE 6: CLEANUP
**Duration:** 30 seconds

1. **Remove Ranked Cards**
   - All cards used in ranking → removed from game permanently
   - Do NOT refill the pool at this time

2. **Maintain Pool Size**
   - Active pool now has fewer than 10 cards
   - This reduction carries over to next time this category is selected
   - Pool only refills to 10 AFTER blocking phase

3. **Remove Used Tokens**
   - Used blocking tokens → removed from game
   - Unused tokens → kept by players

4. **Update Scores**
   - Record points on score sheet
   - Announce running totals

5. **Pass Tokens**
   - First Player marker → clockwise to next player

## STRATEGY GUIDE

### Category Selection Strategy

**When to Choose Your Strong Category:**
- You're behind in points
- You have high-value tokens
- Opponents are weak in that area

**When to Choose Your Weak Category:**
- You're ahead and playing safe
- You want to deny opponents
- You have few tokens left

**Reading the Table:**
- Track which categories players prefer
- Notice who struggles with what
- Use selection to control game flow

### Bidding Strategy

**Conservative Approach:**
- Bid 3-5 cards early
- Learn the card pool
- Save tokens for defense

**Aggressive Approach:**
- Bid 7-10 cards
- Force token usage
- Maximize point potential

**Situational Bidding:**
- Few tokens left? Bid high
- Many unknowns? Bid low
- Leading score? Play safe
- Behind? Take risks

### Blocking Strategy

**Token Management:**
- 2-point: Use early/often
- 4-point: Mid-game power
- 6-point: Save for crucial blocks

**What to Block:**
- Obvious extremes (largest/smallest)
- Cards you know
- Force difficult middle rankings

**When to Pass:**
- Low bids (not worth tokens)
- You need the cards too
- Saving for your turn

### Ranking Strategy

**The Anchor Method:**
1. Identify certain cards first
2. Place these as anchors
3. Fill gaps with educated guesses
4. Use elimination for remainder

**Risk Assessment:**
- 100% sure on 4? Bid 4
- 80% sure on 6? Maybe bid 5
- Consider blocking probability

**Common Patterns:**
- Geographic neighbors often similar
- Release years indicate eras
- Franchise films cluster together

## DESIGN NOTES

Outrank emerged from a simple question: "What if trivia wasn't just about knowing the answer, but understanding relationships?" The game rewards players who can identify patterns, make educated guesses, and manage resources wisely.

The category selection mechanism adds another layer of strategy—do you pick your strong suit or deny opponents theirs? This rotating choice ensures everyone has moments to shine and struggle.

The blocking mechanism adds interaction and forces players to think beyond their own knowledge. The permanent removal of cards ensures each game tells a unique story as the available information constantly shifts.

Whether you're a trivia buff or a strategic gamer, Outrank offers multiple paths to victory. Knowledge helps, but it's not everything—sometimes the player who manages their tokens best or reads their opponents correctly will emerge victorious.

Good luck, and may you always rank correctly!
